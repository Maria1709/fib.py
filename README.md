Fibonacci 1.py Solution


Function.py Solution
in function.py we were asked to use a function called factorial, that takes a single input/argument 
which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the postiive nembers less than it, also testing the function by calling it with the values 5,7 and 10.
To do this i used a non negative integer "n" and asked the user to enter a number. next i used the word "result" as  my final output. i then used "for" to do a loop and range for the numbers i required. to get the computer to get me the numbers from 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 i used (n,0,-1) then for my last and final output i used result = result*i
i then asked the computer to Print("factorial of," n "is result - i put quotes around the factorial and the result as this is what i wanted the computer to calculate, anything i did not want printed to screen i did not put quotes around.you are therefor on the ouput page able to enter individually the number 5,7 or 10 ot test.
