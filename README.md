No.1 Fibonacci 1.py
Q.Calculate the nth Fibonacci number where n the sum of the first and last letters of your first name as numbers. Take A as the number 1, B as 2, C as 3, and so on.
Q.

No.2 Fibonaci 2.py
Q.Change the string variable to contain your own surname, and rerun it. 
A.


No.3 Collatz
Q. Write a single Python script that starts with an integer and repeatedly applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) using a while loop and if statement. At each iteration, the current value of the integer should be printed to the screen. You can specify in your code the starting value of 17.
A.


No.4 Project Euler 5.py
Q. Write a Python program using for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20. 
A.

No.5 Openfile.py
Q. Write a Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns.
A.



No.6 Function.py Solution
Q.Write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.
A.in function.py we were asked to use a function called factorial, that takes a single input/argument 
which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the postiive nembers less than it, also testing the function by calling it with the values 5,7 and 10.
To do this i used a non negative integer "n" and asked the user to enter a number. next i used the word "result" as  my final output. i then used "for" to do a loop and range for the numbers i required. to get the computer to get me the numbers from 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 i used (n,0,-1) then for my last and final output i used result = result*i
i then asked the computer to Print("factorial of," n "is result - i put quotes around the factorial and the result as this is what i wanted the computer to calculate, anything i did not want printed to screen i did not put quotes around.you are therefor on the ouput page able to enter individually the number 5,7 or 10 ot test.
